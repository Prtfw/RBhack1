<!-- the plan:


MVP - 1 compelete:

1. prompt to ask for item they are saving for 

2. ask for how much it it 

3. ask for how much $ they have now

4. ask for how much they are saving each day/week

5. a submit button that does the calclation 

6. output how long it will take 


Make it fancy: 

1. make it look nice

2. add date to mvp step 5

3. add animation (i.e. show happy face)

4. link to image of item?
